As an engineering student at the École polytechnique in Paris, I am doing a master-level research internship within the COeXISTENCE project, on the topic of coalition games in urban networks. My studies focus on operations research, algorithmics and game theory, and I have a particular interest for networks and transportation. Over the last years, I have followed a pluridisciplinary education that includes physics and economics.
