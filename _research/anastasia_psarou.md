My name is Anastasia Psarou. I am a PhD student currently working as part of the COeXISTENCE team towards training machines to drive better than humans using Reinforcement Learning. I earned my master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Thessaly in Greece, specializing in software development and artificial intelligence. Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy travelling and immersing myself in nature through activities like hiking. 

I have a keen interest in software development, particularly exploring the integration of artificial intelligence into various aspects of our daily lives. My master's thesis focused on the task of "translating" videos featuring individuals using Greek sign language to facilitate understanding of its meaning.
