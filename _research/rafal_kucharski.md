bio: I am an Associate Professor at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Jagiellonian University in Krakow (Poland) with the Group of Machine Learning Research GMUM. I run the ERC Starting Grant COeXISTENCE where I bridge between ML and transportation - we simulate how intelligent machines compete with humans for limited urban resources (space) and what can we expect as well as the NCN Opus Grant on Shared Mobility in the pandemic times. I am also involved in Horizon Europe project, SUM.

I research complex social systems: **urban mobility**. Congested, urban multimodal networks used by millions of agents to reach their destinations and leaving huge sets of mobility traces ready to be applied for modelling, optimization, understanding and control. Full [CV](/assets/pdf/cv_eng_2022.pdf).

Currently, I run the **ERC Starting Grant COeXISTENCE** where I bridge between ML and transportation - we simulate how intelligent machines compete with humans for limited urban resources (space) and what can we expect. See details [here](https://rafalkucharskipk.github.io/COeXISTENCE/).
I am an**Associate Professor** at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of the **Jagiellonian University** in Krakow (Poland) with the **Group of Machine Learning Research** [GMUM](http://www.gmum.net). I run the *NCN Opus Grant* on Shared Mobility in the pandemic times, *ERC StG* and *Horizon Europe* projects.

Before, I worked (2019-2021) with prof. Oded Cats at TU Delft in his ERC Starting Grant [Critical MaaS](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/over-faculteit/afdelingen/transport-planning/labs/smart-public-transport-lab/criticalmaas). I modelled two-sided mobility platforms, specifcally focusing on ride-pooling ([ExMAS](https://github.com/RafalKucharskiPK/ExMAS)) and agent-based simulator for Uber-like systems ([MaaSSim](https://github.com/RafalKucharskiPK/MaaSSim)). I did PhD at Cracow University of Technology with an excellent goup of prof. [Andrzej Szarata](http://www.kst.pk.edu.pl/) and working closely with [Guido Gentile](https://www.dicea.uniroma1.it/users/guidogentileuniroma1it) from La Sapienza on non-equilibrium dynamic traffic assignment. In the interdisciplinary field of _urban mobility_ I did research which can be classified as: 
* model estimation, optimization, system control, network design;
* agent-based simulation, game-theory, network science, stochastic simulation, epidemic modelling;
* machine learning, spatial analysis, big data analysis, pattern recognition, unsupervised learning;
* behavioural modelling, economic discrete choice models, policy, sustainability.

**Teaching materials**

I run the seminar on Complex Social Systems (transport is one of them) at the Jagiellonian University - [materials and papers are on my github](https://github.com/RafalKucharskiPK/ComplexSocialSystemsCourse/blob/main/Course.ipynb).
