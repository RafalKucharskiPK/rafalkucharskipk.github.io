1. About me

Hello there! My name is Onur, I'm a Computer Engineer with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. I am from a lovely city called Eskişehir in Türkiye. My journey in this field began at Yıldız Technical University in Istanbul, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. For my thesis, I worked on an exciting medical AI project that leveraged computer vision. After completing my Bachelor's degree, I spent two years in Italy, pursuing a master's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Padova. During my time at UNIPD,  

I specialized in AI & Robotics and focused my research on Natural Language Processing. My thesis involved proposing a novel static word embedding model. Outside of work, I am passionate about traveling and learning about different culinary practices. Currently, I am thrilled to be a member of the COeXISTENCE team here at Jagiellonian University in the beautiful city of Kraków. Here I continue my learning journey and contribute to building  
a deeper understanding of the interaction between humans and autonomous agents in future traffic environments. 

2. Interests & Expertise 

In today's fast-changing world of AI, the interactions of various subfields are not just beneficial, but essential. Consequently, I believe that every AI enthusiast is responsible for staying up-to-date with every other subfield, regardless of the specific professional focus. With this mindset, my previous research interests and projects span deep learning, classifiers and regressors, computer vision, clustering algorithms, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing. Also, I have experience with mobile development and The Robotic Operating System. Currently, I am continuing my studies on reinforcement learning. I am exploring innovative methods to model learning in simulations that mirror natural learning processes, aiming for accuracy and efficiency.
