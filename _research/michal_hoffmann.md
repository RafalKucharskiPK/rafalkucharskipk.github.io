I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Theoretical Computer Science at Jagiellonian University. My research focuses on competition in the transportation, where I combine Game Theory with Machine Learning to explore the impact of conflicts on everyday commuter. I love to work on intersection of various fields where I can use sometimes unorthodox methods solving my problems.

Outside of the lab I enjoy mountain trekking and I never pass up a good book!
