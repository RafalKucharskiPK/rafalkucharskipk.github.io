Adjunct (assistant professor) at Jagiellonian University (May 2022 - January 2024), where I researched complex social systems such as urban mobility. Always curious about technological innovations and therefore earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science & Engineering. I strived for a complete understanding of Cloud Computing/Big Data and always anxious to learn something new. My research interests and competencies encompassed application aspects of distributed systems, cloud computing and Cloud-centric Data Acquisition. I focused on enabling cloud for data acquisition, synchronization and persistence. 

My Research Focus: 

Cloud-centric IoT | Data Acquisition & Curation | Cloud Computing | Wellness-based Ubiquitous Platforms | Performance-based Applications | Software Engineering & Architecture | Parallel & Distributed Systems | Urban Mobility
