Adjunct (assistant professor) at Jagiellonian University (May 2022 - January 2024),
where I researched complex social systems such as urban mobility. My research interests and
competencies encompass application aspects of distributed systems, cloud computing and Cloudcentric Data Acquisition. I focused on enabling cloud for data acquisition, synchronization and
persistence.

Adjunct (assistant professor) at Jagiellonian University (May 2022 - January 2024), where I researched complex social systems such as urban mobility. Always curious about technological innovations and therefore earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science & Engineering. Strives for a complete understanding of Cloud Computing/Big Data and is always anxious to learn something new. Enjoys writing small programs in free time, either to automate everyday problems or simply for the sake of fun and is excited by the seemingly endless possibilities. My research interests and competencies encompass application aspects of distributed systems, cloud computing and Cloud-centric Data Acquisition. I focused on enabling cloud for data acquisition, synchronization and persistence. 

My Research Focus: 

Cloud-centric IoT | Data Acquisition & Curation | Cloud Computing | Wellness-based Ubiquitous Platforms | Performance-based Applications | Software Engineering & Architecture | Parallel & Distributed Systems | Urban Mobility.
