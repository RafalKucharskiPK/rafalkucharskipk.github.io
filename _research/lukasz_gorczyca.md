I am a data scientist in the COeXISTENCE project. As a student, I am affiliated with the Jagiellonian University, where I completed my bachelor's degree in applied mathematics, which I am currently pursuing in my master's degree. In addition, I am also studying computational mathematics for my master's degree. My broad research interests include free probability theory, stochastic processes, machine learning in drug discovery and social data analysis.
