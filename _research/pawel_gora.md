I completed my Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Warsaw. As a researcher, I primarily work in AI, quantum computing, complex processes, and intelligent transportation systems. I have co-authored over 30 scientific articles, participated in over 10 research grants, and received several awards.
Outside of academia, I advise startups and serve as the CEO of two non-profit organizations, Fundacja Quantum AI and QWorld, which support education and research in new technologies.
