[**Fryderyk Falniowski**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fryderyk-falniowski-2a77a151/) presented his work titled _Heterogeneity, Reinforcement&nbsp;Learning and Chaos in Population&nbsp;Games_.

**Abstract**: Inspired by the challenges at the intersection of Evolutionary&nbsp;Game&nbsp;Theory and Machine&nbsp;Learning, we investigate a class of discrete-time multi-agent reinforcement&nbsp;learning (MARL) dynamics in population/non-atomic congestion&nbsp;games, where agents have diverse beliefs and learn at different rates. These congestion&nbsp;games, a well-studied class of potential&nbsp;games, are characterized by individual agents having negligible effects on system performance, strongly aligned incentives, and well-understood advantageous properties of Nash&nbsp;equilibria. Despite the presence of static Nash&nbsp;equilibria, we demonstrate that MARL dynamics with heterogeneous learning rates can deviate from these equilibria, exhibiting instability and even chaotic behavior and resulting in increased social costs. Remarkably, even within these chaotic regimes, we show that the time-averaged macroscopic behavior converges to exact Nash&nbsp;equilibria, thus linking the microscopic dynamic complexity with traditional equilibrium concepts. By employing dynamical systems techniques, we analyze the interaction between individual-level adaptation and population-level outcomes, paving the way for studying heterogeneous learning dynamics in discrete time across more complex game scenarios.
