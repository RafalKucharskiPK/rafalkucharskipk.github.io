After a longer break, we have returned from the summer holidays to our tradition of seminar meetings. Today at our Krak√≥w lab, we&nbsp;had the pleasure of&nbsp;hosting [**Julian Sienkiewicz**](https://jsienkiewicz.pl/index.php/pl) from Warsaw University of Technology, who delivered a seminar: _Agent-based modeling of Multilevel Information Overload: assumptions and expectations_. Many thanks to our guest for an incredibly interesting presentation, and to all team members for their presence and engaging discussion.
