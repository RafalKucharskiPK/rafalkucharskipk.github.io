🗞 This Saturday, join us for an exciting discussion on the future of urban mobility! On February 14, 2026, [Rafal](https://www.rafalkucharskilab.pl/research/rafal_kucharski/) will be presenting at the [AAAS Annual Meeting](https://meetings.aaas.org/) – Science @ Scale in Phoenix, Arizona.

As part of a session organized by the European Research Council ([**ERC**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/european-research-council/)) alongside [Cristina Grasseni](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/cristina-grasseni#tab-1), [Monika Salzbrunn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/monika-salzbrunn-3a578782/), and [Silvia Grassi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silvia-grassi-b314775b/), they will explore _**“A Path to Building Better Cities”**_.
Rafal's talk highlights how Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), like Waymo, may affect urban systems as they scale up, sharing public space with "human road users". Results range from cautious to optimistic, emphasizing the need for thoughtful safeguards in urban mobility.

Don’t miss it – save the date and join us in shaping the cities of tomorrow!
