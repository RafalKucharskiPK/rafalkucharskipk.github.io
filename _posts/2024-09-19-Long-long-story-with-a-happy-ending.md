This is a happy end of the super long story that started in 2020, with results and submission in 2021, followed with 2 rejections from journals, one rejection due to lack of reviewers and a lot of minor revisions. In this particular case we waited 3 years to publish our results, which can be now followed and developed in **npj Sustainable Mobility and Transport**. In this paper we proved that [we can identify pooled rides of up to 14 people, with occupancies of 6 and more](https://rafalkucharskipk.github.io/assets/img/pooled-rides-2024-with-O.-Cats-npj.jfif), with our hyper-pool algorithm. This while remaining attractive to all travellers (against private ride) and in many cases even competing with PT (in Amsterdam, where PT quality is excellent). Already 200 trip requests per 30-min batch (4000 trips per hour) in Amsterdam allows to identify high-occupancy hyper-pooled trips.
