We started 2025 with good news - our [open access publication](https://lnkd.in/ei3jQ8HR) with the TU Delft friends is already available in the _Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice_. In this paper using agent-based simulation modelling on the realistic case study of the city of Amsterdam, the Netherlands, we study the impacts of drivers’ ride acceptance behaviour, estimated from unique empirical data, on the ride-sourcing system where the platform applies regular and surge pricing strategies, and riders may revoke their requests and reject the received offers. Furthermore, we delve into the implications of various supply–demand intensities, a centralised fleet (i.e., mandatory acceptance on each ride request) versus a decentralised fleet (i.e., ride acceptance decision by each driver), ride acceptance rates, and surge pricing settings.

An agent-based simulation, **MaSSim** is public and you can get it from [this repo](https://github.com/RafalKucharskiPK/MaaSSim) for more research like this.
