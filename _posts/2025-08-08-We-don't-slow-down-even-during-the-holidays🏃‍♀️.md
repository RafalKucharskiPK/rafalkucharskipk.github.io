Last two weeks of July were very busy time for [Anastasia](https://www.rafalkucharskilab.pl/research/anastasia_psarou/) who attended the [**DLRL Summer School 2025**](https://dlrl.ca/) in Edmonton, Canada. It allowed to expand her knowledge on reinforcement learning. A highlight was the keynote by [**Richard Sutton**](http://incompleteideas.net/). She also worked with [Lucas Cruz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasdearaujocruz/) on a project based on an idea she proposed, which they presented on the final day. We are glad we could support her visit!
