🤔 Thinking about launching an on-demand feeder service in your city?
🫡 But where? And how will people travel?

🧪 Meet [**SimFLEX**](https://rafalkucharskipk.github.io/assets/img/simflex.jpg) — a simulation framework that shows where on-demand feeder buses can be most effective, using spatial data, demand modelling, shared-ride creation, and traveller learning to deliver KPIs like attractiveness and waiting-time reduction.

💡 Bronowice or Skotniki in Kraków?
