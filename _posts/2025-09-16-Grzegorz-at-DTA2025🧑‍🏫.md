Today, during the [**10th International Symposium on Dynamic Traffic Assignment**](https://www.motusanimi.it/dta2025/) (DTA2025) in Salerno [Grzegorz](https://www.rafalkucharskilab.pl/research/grzegorz_jamroz/), on behalf of [Gunnar Fl√∂tter√∂d](https://liu.se/en/employee/gunfl93), [Rafa≈Ç Kucharski]( https://www.rafalkucharskilab.pl/research/rafal_kucharski/) and [David Watling]( https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/transport/staff/987/professor-david-watling), is presenting the work _Coexistence of human drivers and CAVs - behavioral models and long-term properties_. DTA is dedicated to the latest research and methods for modeling dynamic traffic assignment, which help better understand and predict road users‚Äô behavior in real time. This year‚Äôs edition offers a valuable opportunity for Grzegorz to share insights on cutting-edge optimization, simulation, and analysis methods for transportation systems aimed at enhancing efficient traffic management.
