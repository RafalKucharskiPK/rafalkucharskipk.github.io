💡 How can we balance network efficiency with virus safety?
In our study published in [Social Network Analysis and Mining](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13278-025-01523-x) we show how the [**DEEN**](https://rafalkucharskipk.github.io/assets/img/SNAM2025.jpg) (Deep Epidemic Efficiency Network) model can:
✅ increase system efficiency
✅ reduce the risk of virus spread

We tested it on:
🚕 ride-pooling services in New York City,
🇵🇱 economic exchange between regions in Poland,
🌐 peer-to-peer information networks.

Example? Dividing 150 NYC taxi riders into 4 groups more than doubled the epidemic threshold, while system utility dropped by only 13%!
