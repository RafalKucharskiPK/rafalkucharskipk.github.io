Members of our Lab are keeping busy during the conference season. Today, [Onur]( https://www.rafalkucharskilab.pl/research/onur_akman/) is presenting his work titled "Routing Autonomous Vehicles Using RL – Progress and Future Directions" at [**The 18th European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning (EWRL 2025)**](https://ewrl.wordpress.com/ewrl18-2025/) in Tübingen. This is another [edition](https://www.rafalkucharskilab.pl/assets/img/Onur%20at%20EWRL.jpg) with our participation, and therefore another opportunity for broad discussion on open problems and future research directions within the European reinforcement learning research community.
