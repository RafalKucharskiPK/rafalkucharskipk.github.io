title: COeXISTENCE team hit the ground running by participating in TRB2025
description: RafaÅ‚ Kucharski and the COeXISTENCE team kick off 2025 with participation in the TRB Annual Meeting in Washington. Discover their innovative framework, "Routing ZOO," for measuring properties of microscopic traffic equilibria and exploring urban mobility systems. Check out preliminary results and their draft repository for further experiments.

ðŸ“¢ It is becoming our tradition to begin the New Year at [**TRB Annual Meeting**](https://trb-annual-meeting.nationalacademies.org/). On 6th of January in Washington [ZoltÃ¡n](https://www.rafalkucharskilab.pl/research/zoltan_varga/) and [Grzegorz](https://www.rafalkucharskilab.pl/research/grzegorz_jamroz/) presented our poster titled _Framework to Measure Properties of Microscopic Traffic Equilibria_ 
It shows what we called [Routing ZOO](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQGRuVAdGcW8QA/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4DZQ8zlS8G0Ao-/0/1736186946189?e=1740009600&v=beta&t=udpScLymhehHDNHcjgcx3GA-YfaeKAlmBxkNH_CVYJo) (a sumo-based framework) thanks to which we want to check what Microscopic Traffic Assignment really is: what are its properties, stability, is it equilibrium etc.

Draft repo, that soon we will use for bigger experiments, is [here](https://lnkd.in/dC9Ss6D5).
