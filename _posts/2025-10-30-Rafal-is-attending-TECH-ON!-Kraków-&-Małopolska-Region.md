Already today, during [**TECH-ON! Kraków & Małopolska Region**](https://www.techon.krakow.pl/program) [Rafał](https://www.rafalkucharskilab.pl/research/rafal_kucharski/), together with other invited speakers, will take part in the panel discussion _Future City Innovations_ and in the debate _Innovative Cities — What Are They Like?_, moderated by dr hab. Jacek Gądecki from AGH University of Science and Technology. They will explore what makes a city truly innovative. Who, what, and how shapes cities that are future-ready, resilient to crises, and friendly to their residents? What types of innovations drive such urban development — technological, social, or systemic? What does it mean for a city to be innovative — and who makes it so, and how?
This will be a great opportunity to present the latest research findings from our [COeXISTENCE](https://www.rafalkucharskilab.pl/research/coexistence/) group 💡🔍
