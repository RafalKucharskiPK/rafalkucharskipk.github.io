We are thrilled to inform that the publication, first-authored by [Michał Bujak](https://www.rafalkucharskilab.pl/research/michal_bujak/), has been published in the _**European Journal of Operational Research**_ 💣

In this [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221725009920?dgcid=author) we propose a personalised pricing strategy for ride-pooling that integrates traveller behaviour with shared-trip economics to maximise expected profitability while reducing vehicle mileage through population heterogeneity.
For our team, this is a gratifying culmination of a very hard-working year 🏋️
