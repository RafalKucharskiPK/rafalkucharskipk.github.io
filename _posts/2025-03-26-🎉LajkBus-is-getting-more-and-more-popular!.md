title: 🎉LajkBus is getting more and more popular!
description: The SUM Project, featuring contributions from Rafał Kucharski's team, launched LajkBus, an innovative shared taxi service in Skotniki. This on-demand transport initiative now serves 200 passengers daily, demonstrating the success of collaboration and cutting-edge ride-pooling algorithms like ExMAS, developed at Jagiellonian University.

A shared taxi 🚕 for the price of a bus 🚌 - that's the simplest definition of LajkBus. On February 10th as part of the SUM Project, we launched a pilot service offering convenient on-demand transport. Thanks to it, almost all residents of Skotniki have a virtual public transport stop within a walking distance of 300 meters. It started with 15 and now our 2 vans transport about 2️00 passengers every day! 
Great cooperation of various parties that made it happen!
