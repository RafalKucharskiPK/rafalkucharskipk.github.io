A shared taxi 🚕 for the price of a bus 🚌 - that's the simplest definition of LajkBus. On February 10th as part of the SUM Project, we launched a pilot service offering convenient on-demand transport. Thanks to it, almost all residents of Skotniki have a virtual public transport stop within a walking distance of 300 meters. It started with 15 and now our 2 vans transport about 2️00 passengers every day! 
Great cooperation of various parties that made it happen!
