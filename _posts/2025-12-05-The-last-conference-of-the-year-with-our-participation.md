During one of the most prestigious conferences in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence research, **NeurIPS2025** [our team](https://rafalkucharskipk.github.io/assets/img/teamNIPS.jpg) presented how URB lays the foundation for smarter autonomous vehicle routing for future urban traffic 🚗

[URB](https://rafalkucharskipk.github.io/assets/img/urbNIPSposter.jpg) is a comprehensive benchmarking framework that standardizes AV routing evaluation in realistic traffic scenarios and makes research in this domain more accessible. The study also presents our initial leaderboard of MARL solutions. We hope that URB will catalyze advancements towards efficiency and equity for future urban traffic.

We’re thankful for all the great discussions and feedback! Leaving San Diego, we’re full of energy and buzzing with new ideas.
