Last week at the [CASPT conference](https://caspt.org/) in Kyoto, [Rafal](https://www.rafalkucharskilab.pl/research/rafal_kucharski/) presented **SimFLEX** ‚Äì a microsimulation tool for planning on-demand feeder bus services.
It combines demographic, spatial, and transport data to compare urban areas and assess service efficiency. Applied in Krak√≥w‚Äôs Skotniki and Bronowice districts, SimFLEX revealed Skotniki as the more attractive site, while Bronowice showed greater potential for wait time reduction. Sensitivity analysis on alternative-specific constants confirmed Skotniki as the preferred deployment site.
üîç A powerful tool for smarter urban mobility ‚Äì developed as part of the [SUM](https://www.rafalkucharskilab.pl/research/SUM/) Project.
