🧠 Beautiful minds have recently joined our team:

🟠 [Łukasz Gorczyca](https://www.rafalkucharskilab.pl/research/lukasz_gorczyca/) - a part-time student assistant - simulates the future mixed Human-CAV systems with [𝐑𝐨𝐮𝐭𝐞𝐑𝐋](https://lnkd.in/decCKCWJ)
🟡 [Natello Descormier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natello-descormier-777112248/) - student from École Polytechnique for a 16-week research internship to study coalition games between AVs and humans on urban road networks
🟢 [Paweł Gora](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pawelgora/) - experienced part-time PostDoctoral Researcher - will try to beat the humans on travel times with cutting-edge Reinforcement Learning algorithms (on our forthcoming 𝐮𝐫𝐛 benchmark).

Good luck 👊
