> What will be the future of our cities with autonomous vehicles, using any kind of ML algorithms to make collective routing decisions?


We pioneer the very specific problem that our cities may face in future, when autonomous vehicles are efficiently navigating across our cities. 
They will, individually or collectively, make routing decisions. The same decisions which are now daily made by millions of human drivers worldwide and result in traffic jams and complex congestion patterns, will be delegated to machines.
What will it change? **Let's see**

#### Problem formulation and overall methodology:

> **Disclaimer** <span style="color:red"> we do not address the autonomous driving itself and operations. We assume AVs can well navigate in our cities: start, drive, cruise, detect objects, stop, obey traffic rules and park. </span> Dozens of excellent research teams already contribute to this, we adress the follow-up problem: _What when CAVs will start making our decisions, e.g. routing decisions_. We anegdotically compare it to the case of toddler who learns how to walk, but the true problems come with teenagers who may start to decide (e.g. on colour of hair, tattoos, carreer, etc).

# Findings:

#### CAVs may form exclusive clubs

> We show that [Equilibria in routing games with connected autonomous vehicles will not be strong, as exclusive clubs may form](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12862)

CAVs will be able to break from Nash equilibrium and form a coalitions, collaborating to devise a joint routing pattern, allowing them to arrive faster. However, with limited resources, i.e. the capacity in road networks, a
group arriving faster will gain at the expense of others, arriving later. Also, not everyone can be invited to join the group as remains efficient only until
some point. They will be exclusive, and ,as other exclusive goods, unavailable to masses and limited to upper classes only. Threatening equity of using public space of our cities.

#### Creating travel time oscillations is a good strategy to maximise fleet market share

> We demonstrate the fleet may intentionally bring choas to our cities to maximise market share [here](arxiv)

What is the optimal strategy to maximise market share and convince most drivers to join own fleet? Surprisingly, **bringing chaos** may be quite effective. Controlled oscillations of traffic flows, predictable by fleet operator, surprising to humans may be frustrating enough to convince others to abandon human driving and join some fleet. Individually tailored offers (just like Uber, Amazon or Ryanair) leveraging on our behavioural traits may be exploitable as well, and our low expectations (due to low budget or high urgency) may enable network-wide strange assignment plans, ultimately leading to increasing market shares. Those are initial results from monopoly, where single operator competes with humans, strach pomyśleć co będzie when competing fleets launch aggressive campaigns deployed at our cities.

#### Traffic assingnment be both Nash optimal and equilibrated with CAVs

> New concept of Wardrop Cyclical Equiblibruim is both optimal and fair for CAVs as we show [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19675)

Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) open the possibility for centralised routing with full compliance, making System Optimal traffic assignment attainable. However, as System Optimum makes some drivers better off than others, voluntary acceptance seems dubious. To overcome this issue, we propose a new concept of Wardropian cycles, which, in contrast to previous utopian visions, makes the assignment fair on top of being optimal, which amounts to satisfaction of both Wardrop's principles. Such cycles, represented as sequences of permutations to the daily assignment matrices, always exist and equalise, after a limited number of days, average travel times among travellers (like in User Equilibrium) while preserving everyday optimality of path flows (like in System Optimum). In Barcelona, 670 vehicle-hours of Price-of-Anarchy are eliminated using cycles with a median length of 11 days-though 5% of cycles exceed 90 days.

#### How to simulate such future system?

> We created [RouteRL](https://github.com/COeXISTENCE-PROJECT/RouteRL) Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework for modeling and simulating the collective route choices of humans and autonomous vehicles - [SoftwareX](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2025.102279)
<p align="center">

</p>

RouteRL is a novel framework that integrates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with a microscopic traffic simulation for the development of efficient collective route choice strategies for autonomous vehicles (AVs). The proposed framework models the daily urban route choices of driver agents of two types: human drivers, emulated using behavioral route choice models, and AVs, modeled as MARL agents optimizing their policies for a predefined objective. RouteRL aims to advance research in MARL, transport modeling, and human–AI interaction for transportation applications.

#### State-of-the-art RL algorithms fail even on trivial routing tasks.

> Only few of SOTA Reinforcement Learning algorithms managed to find optimal routing strategy in a trivial case with 10 AVs and two-routes as we report in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13188)

Autonomous vehicles (AVs), possibly using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for simultaneous route optimization, may destabilize traffic networks, with human drivers potentially experiencing longer travel times. We study this interaction by simulating human drivers and AVs. Our experiments with standard MARL algorithms reveal that, both in simplified and complex networks, policies often fail to converge to an optimal solution or require long training periods. This problem is amplified by the fact that we cannot rely entirely on simulated training, as there are no accurate models of human routing behavior. At the same time, real-world training in cities risks destabilizing urban traffic systems, increasing externalities, such as CO2 emissions, and introducing non-stationarity as human drivers will adapt unpredictably to AV behaviors.

#### ML community shall compete to develop efficient algorithms

> We introduced [URB](https://github.com/COeXISTENCE-PROJECT/URB) an Urban Routing Benchmark for MARL algorithms on the fleet routing tasks - [NIPS 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17734)
<p align="center">
   <img src="https://github.com/COeXISTENCE-PROJECT/URB/blob/main/docs/urb.png" alt="drawing" width="150"/> 
</p>

 `URB` is a comprehensive benchmarking environment that unifies evaluation across **29 real-world traffic networks paired with realistic demand patterns**. `URB` comes with a catalog of **predefined tasks, multi-agent RL (MARL) algorithm implementations, three baseline methods, ten domain-specific performance metrics, and a modular configuration scheme**. 

Through this broad experimental scheme, `URB` aims to:

  1. Identify which state-of-the-art algorithms outperform others in this class of tasks,
  2. Drive competition for future algorithmic improvements, and
  3. Clarify the impact of collective CAV routing on congestion, emissions, and sustainability in future cities, equipping policymakers with solid arguments for CAV regulations.

. We create virtual environments where individual agents compete to arrive faster, more reliably and cheaper at their destinations.  Human agents are simulated with detailed behavioural models, estimated and calibrated on the field data to reproduce how we behave and adapt in the cities. In the same environment the deep learning agents try the same - they  use deep reinforcement learning to maximise their rewards. This creates a harsh competition in which machines have upper-hands strong enough to beat us. 



*COeXISTENCE* is a broad and deep experiment in virtual environment on future cities, aimed to discover the new phenomena and propose the new solutions. See the brief overview [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RafalKucharskiPK/rafalkucharskipk.github.io/master/assets/pdf/flyer.pdf) and more thorough [presentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RafalKucharskiPK/rafalkucharskipk.github.io/master/assets/pdf/Wyklad_ERC.pdf).

It spans between fields as diverse as:

* game theory;
* deep reinforcement learning;
* complex social systems;
* sustainability;
* urban mobility;
* agent based modelling;
* discrete choice theory.
