> What will be the future of our cities with autonomous vehicles, using any kind of ML algorithms to make collective routing decisions?
>
> Let's see!

We pioneer the very specific problem that our cities may face in future, when autonomous vehicles are efficiently navigating across our cities. 
They will, individually or collectively, make routing decisions. The same decisions which are now daily made by millions of human drivers worldwide and result in traffic jams and complex congestion patterns, will be delegated to machines.
What will it change? **Let's see**


### This is what we know so far from our research:





#### 1. CAVs will form exclusive clubs

> We show that [Equilibria in routing games with connected autonomous vehicles will not be strong, as exclusive clubs may form](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12862)

CAVs will be able to break from Nash equilibrium and form a coalitions, collaborating to devise a joint routing pattern, allowing them to arrive faster. However, with limited resources, i.e. the capacity in road networks, a
group arriving faster will gain at the expense of others, arriving later. Also, not everyone can be invited to join the group as remains efficient only until
some point. They will be exclusive, and ,as other exclusive goods, unavailable to masses and limited to upper classes only. Threatening equity of using public space of our cities.

#### 2. Creating travel time oscillations is a good strategy to maximise fleet market share

> We demonstrate the fleet may intentionally bring choas to our cities to maximise market share [here](arxiv)

What is the optimal strategy to maximise market share and convince most drivers to join own fleet? Surprisingly, **bringing chaos** may be quite effective. Controlled oscillations of traffic flows, predictable by fleet operator, surprising to humans may be frustrating enough to convince others to abandon human driving and join some fleet. Individually tailored offers (just like Uber, Amazon or Ryanair) leveraging on our behavioural traits may be exploitable as well, and our low expectations (due to low budget or high urgency) may enable network-wide strange assignment plans, ultimately leading to increasing market shares. Those are initial results from monopoly, where single operator competes with humans, strach pomyśleć co będzie when competing fleets launch aggressive campaigns deployed at our cities.

#### 3. Can a traffic assingnment be both Nash optimal and equilibrated? Yes!

> New concept of Wardrop Cyclical Equiblibruim is both optimal and fair for CAVs as we show [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19675)

Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) open the possibility for centralised routing with full compliance, making System Optimal traffic assignment attainable. However, as System Optimum makes some drivers better off than others, voluntary acceptance seems dubious. To overcome this issue, we propose a new concept of Wardropian cycles, which, in contrast to previous utopian visions, makes the assignment fair on top of being optimal, which amounts to satisfaction of both Wardrop's principles. Such cycles, represented as sequences of permutations to the daily assignment matrices, always exist and equalise, after a limited number of days, average travel times among travellers (like in User Equilibrium) while preserving everyday optimality of path flows (like in System Optimum). In Barcelona, 670 vehicle-hours of Price-of-Anarchy are eliminated using cycles with a median length of 11 days-though 5% of cycles exceed 90 days.

We want to understand the future of Urban Mobility and foresee what happens when our cities are shared with autonomous, intelligent robots - competing with us for limited resources. 
* We demonstrated the novel phenomena on simple topologies [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-90783-w)
* We created the dedicated MARL environment for our experiments [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20065) and repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/COeXISTENCE-PROJECT/RouteRL)
* We have some preliminary results from [EWRL](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=88zP8xh5D2)
* We identified issues with convergence and reported them [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13188)

. We create virtual environments where individual agents compete to arrive faster, more reliably and cheaper at their destinations.  Human agents are simulated with detailed behavioural models, estimated and calibrated on the field data to reproduce how we behave and adapt in the cities. In the same environment the deep learning agents try the same - they  use deep reinforcement learning to maximise their rewards. This creates a harsh competition in which machines have upper-hands strong enough to beat us. 



*COeXISTENCE* is a broad and deep experiment in virtual environment on future cities, aimed to discover the new phenomena and propose the new solutions. See the brief overview [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RafalKucharskiPK/rafalkucharskipk.github.io/master/assets/pdf/flyer.pdf) and more thorough [presentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RafalKucharskiPK/rafalkucharskipk.github.io/master/assets/pdf/Wyklad_ERC.pdf).

It spans between fields as diverse as:

* game theory;
* deep reinforcement learning;
* complex social systems;
* sustainability;
* urban mobility;
* agent based modelling;
* discrete choice theory.
