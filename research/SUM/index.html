<p>Transformation of existing transport networks by introducing New and Shared Mobility integrated with public transport</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="/./assets/img/p_sum/0964_SUM_LOGO_RGB_HR.jpg" alt="drawing" height="100">
</p>

<p>Welcome to the SUM project, where we are redefining urban mobility by integrating new and shared transportation modes with existing public transit systems of 15 European cities by 2026 and in 30 European cities by 2030, focussing on innovation, interconnectivity, environmental sustainability, safety, resilience, and replicability. By 2050, the urban population is expected to account for 82% of the worldâ€™s population, posing major challenges for sustainable urban mobility. A shift from private cars to public and shared transport is essential to address problems such as air pollution, congestion, and energy consumption.</p>

</p>

<p>Under Rafal Kucharski supervision with the team of 4 researchers from the Urban Mobility group, we use the ExMAS algorithm to match trips into attractive shared rides. This approach allows estimating the potential of shared rides, where people share their trips simultaneously with other co-travellers in the same vehicle (e.g., taxi or Uber). As part of the project, the potential of this type of rides will be explored in selected areas of Munich, Geneva, Athens, Jerusalem, and Krakow. The city of Krakow (a partner in the project) plans to open its van-pooling services integrated with the tram. Due to the proposed method, the city could identify areas with high potential for success. Out of 11 candidate areas now, the two are under further investigation to help make a proper decision on where and how to introduce the new system.</p>

      <p>On-demand feeder bus services present an innovative solution to urban mobility challenges, yet their success depends on thorough assessment and strategic planning. Despite their potential, a comprehensive framework for evaluating feasibility and identifying suitable service areas remains underdeveloped. Simulation Framework for Feeder Location Evaluation (SimFLEX) uses spatial, demographic, and transport-specific data to run microsimulations and compute key performance indicators (KPIs), including service attractiveness, waiting time reduction, and added value. SimFLEX employs multiple replications to estimate demand and mode choices and integrates OpenTripPlanner (OTP) for public transport routing and ExMAS for calculating shared trip attributes and KPIs. For each demand scenario, we model the traveler learning process using the method of successive averages (MSA), stabilizing the system. After stabilization, we calculate KPIs for comparative and sensitivity analyzes. We applied SimFLEX to compare two remote urban areas in Krakow, Poland - Bronowice and Skotniki - the candidates for service launch. Our analysis revealed notable differences between analyzed areas: Skotniki exhibited higher service attractiveness (up to 30%) and added value (up to 7%), while Bronowice showed greater potential for reducing waiting times (by nearly 77%). To assess the reliability of our model output, we conducted a sensitivity analysis across a range of alternative-specific constants (ASC). The results consistently confirmed Skotniki as the superior candidate for service implementation. SimFLEX can be instrumental for policymakers to estimate new service performance in the considered area, publicly available and applicable to various use cases. It can integrate alternative models and approaches, making it a versatile tool for policymakers and urban planners to enhance urban mobility.</p>

      <p>Before the pandemic, ride-pooling was a promising mode of urban mobility, marked by increasing service providers and increasing traveller adoption, critical to its efficiency and sustainability. However, the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruption, with services suspended, business models altered, and reduced traveller confidence. In the post-pandemic era, understanding the future of ride-pooling is crucial. This article reviews the market through literature, pooling availability, and traveller behaviour studies. We find that the core elements of the ride-pooling model remain intact, with potential to appeal to travellers, drivers, platforms, and policymakers. Changes in travel behaviour due to the pandemic appear temporary, with a high willingness to share rides and reduce costs. However, whether ride-pooling can regain its growth remains uncertain. Despite unprecedented start-up activity, the financial prospects are unclear, posing challenges to its resurgence as a sustainable mobility solution.</p>

      <p>Mobility platforms such as Uber and DiDi have been introduced in cities worldwide, each demonstrating varying degrees of success, employing diverse strategies, and exerting distinct impacts on urban mobility. We have observed various growth trajectories in two-sided mobility markets and understood the underlying mechanisms. However, to date, a realistic microscopic model of these markets including phenomena such as network effects has been missing. State-of-the-art methods well estimate the macroscopic equilibrium conditions in the market, but struggle to reproduce the individual human behavior behind and complex growth patterns sensitive to platform strategy and policies.
To bridge this gap, we introduce the MoMaS (two-sided Mobility Market Simulation) framework to represent growth mechanism in two-sided mobility markets based on the realistic behavior adjustment of drivers and travelers reactive to platform strategy. In the proposed framework, traveler and driver agents learn the platform utility from multiple channels: their own experience, peersâ€™ word-of-mouth, and the platformâ€™s marketing, all-together constituting the agentâ€™s perceived utility of the platform. Each of these channels is modeled and updated by our S-shaped learning model day-to-day which stabilizes, and at the same time, remains sensitive to the system changes. The platform can simulate any strategy on five levers: trip fare, commission rate, discount rate, incentive rate, and marketing.
While detailed empirical data and actual strategies for platform growth remain largely unknown, MoMaS allows to reproduce series of plausible growth trajectories that were previously unattainable. The framework facilitates the modeling of individual-level behaviors such as reluctance, neutrality, and loyalty, alongside aggregate-level dynamics like critical mass, bandwagon effects, and both positive and negative cross-side network effects.
We illustrate the capabilities of MoMaS through an extensive set of real-world experiments. Our results demonstrate that once the platform acquires critical mass, it triggers a significant positive cross-side network effect, accelerating growth. However, this can be reversed if a negative cross-side network effect is triggered, leading to the collapse of the platform. MoMaS is applicable for real-sized problems and available on public repository along with reproducible experiments.</p>

      <p>In a ride-pooling system, travellers experience discomfort associated with a detour and a longer travel time, which is compensated with a sharing discount. Most studies assume travellers receive either a flat discount or, in rare cases, a proportional to the inconvenience. We show the system benefits from individually tailored fares. We argue that fares that optimise an expected profit of an operator also improve system-wide performance if they include travellersâ€™ acceptance.
Our pricing method is set in a heterogeneous population, where travellers have varying levels of value-of-time and willingness-to-share, unknown to the operator. A high fare discourages clients from the service, while a low fare reduces the profit margin. Notably, a shared ride is only realised if accepted by all co-travellers (decision is driven by the latent behavioural factors).
Our method reveals intriguing properties of the shareability topology. Not only identifies rides efficient for the system and supports them with reduced fares (to increase their realisation probability), but also identifies travellers unattractive for the system (e.g. due to incompatibility with other travellers) and effectively shifts them to private rides via high fares. Unlike in previous methods, such approach naturally balances the travellers satisfaction and the profit maximisation. With an experiment set in NYC, we show that this leads to significant improvements over the flat discount baseline: the mileage (proxy for environmental externalities) is reduced by 4.5% and the operator generates more profit per mile (over 20% improvement). We argue that ride pooling systems with fares that maximise profitability are more sustainable and efficient if they include travellersâ€™ satisfaction.</p>
