<p>Transformation of existing transport networks by introducing New and Shared Mobility integrated with public transport</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="/./assets/img/p_sum/0964_SUM_LOGO_RGB_HR.jpg" alt="drawing" height="100">
</p>

<p>Welcome to the SUM project, where we are redefining urban mobility by integrating new and shared transportation modes with existing public transit systems of 15 European cities by 2026 and in 30 European cities by 2030, focussing on innovation, interconnectivity, environmental sustainability, safety, resilience, and replicability. By 2050, the urban population is expected to account for 82% of the world’s population, posing major challenges for sustainable urban mobility. A shift from private cars to public and shared transport is essential to address problems such as air pollution, congestion, and energy consumption.</p>

</p>

<p>Under Rafal Kucharski supervision with the team of 4 researchers from the Urban Mobility group, we use the ExMAS algorithm to match trips into attractive shared rides. This approach allows estimating the potential of shared rides, where people share their trips simultaneously with other co-travellers in the same vehicle (e.g., taxi or Uber). As part of the project, the potential of this type of rides will be explored in selected areas of Munich, Geneva, Athens, Jerusalem, and Krakow. The city of Krakow (a partner in the project) plans to open its van-pooling services integrated with the tram. Due to the proposed method, the city could identify areas with high potential for success. Out of 11 candidate areas now, the two are under further investigation to help make a proper decision on where and how to introduce the new system.</p>

      <p>Ride-sourcing platforms such as Uber and Lyft are prime examples of the gig economy, recruiting drivers as independent contractors, thereby avoiding legal and fiscal obligations. Although platforms offer flexibility in choosing work shifts and areas, many drivers experience low income and poor working conditions, leading to widespread strikes and protests. Minimum wage regulation is adopted to improve drivers welfare. However, the impacts of this regulation on drivers as well as on travelers and platforms, remain largely unknown. While ride-sourcing platforms do not disclose the relevant data, state-of-the-art models fail to explain the effects of minimum wage regulation on market dynamics. In this study, we assess the effectiveness and implications of minimum wage regulation in ride-sourcing markets while simulating the detailed dynamics of ride-sourcing markets under varying regulation intensities, both with and without the so-called platform lockout strategy. Our findings reveal that minimum wage regulation impacts substantially drivers income, and may lead to higher fares for travelers and threaten platforms survival. When platforms adopt a lockout strategy, their profitability significantly improves and drivers earn more, although many others lose their jobs, and service level for travelers consequently declines.</p>

      <p>In a ride-pooling system, travellers experience discomfort associated with a detour and a longer travel time, which is compensated with a sharing discount. Most studies assume homogeneous travellers that receive either a flat discount or, in rare cases, a proportional to the inconvenience. This simplified approach offers inaccurate results and leads to an underperforming service when tested against diverse and natural human behaviour. We improve the standard approach on two bases. First, we propose a stochastic setting, where we leverage the population distribution of behavioural traits to determine the acceptance probability. Second, we personalise fares. Each traveller receives a sharing discount based on their contribution to the system such that the operator maximises his expected profitability. In the study, we rigorously prove that the discount optimisation problem can be decomposed. We optimise discounts at a ride level to claim the system optimum. An operator, when proposing fares, encounters two counteracting effects. Low fares increase realisation probability while high fares improve profit from a realised ride. In the personalised discount optimisation, we seek the golden mean. Travellers, who are well-aligned and experience minimal discomfort of sharing, are offered higher fares than those who require more incentive to join the service. Unlike in previous methods, our approach naturally balances the travellers satisfaction and the profit maximisation. With an experiment set in NYC, we show that this leads to significant improvements over the flat discount baseline: the mileage is reduced by 4.5% and the operator generates more profit per mile (over 20% improvement)</p>

      <p>Mobility platforms such as Uber and DiDi have been introduced in cities worldwide, each demonstrating varying degrees of success, employing diverse strategies, and exerting distinct impacts on urban mobility. We have observed various growth trajectories in two-sided mobility markets and understood the underlying mechanisms. However, to date, a realistic microscopic model of these markets including phenomena such as network effects has been missing. State-of-the-art methods well estimate the macroscopic equilibrium conditions in the market, but struggle to reproduce the individual human behavior behind and complex growth patterns sensitive to platform strategy and policies.
To bridge this gap, we introduce the MoMaS (two-sided Mobility Market Simulation) framework to represent growth mechanism in two-sided mobility markets based on the realistic behavior adjustment of drivers and travelers reactive to platform strategy. In the proposed framework, traveler and driver agents learn the platform utility from multiple channels: their own experience, peers’ word-of-mouth, and the platform’s marketing, all-together constituting the agent’s perceived utility of the platform. Each of these channels is modeled and updated by our S-shaped learning model day-to-day which stabilizes, and at the same time, remains sensitive to the system changes. The platform can simulate any strategy on five levers: trip fare, commission rate, discount rate, incentive rate, and marketing.
While detailed empirical data and actual strategies for platform growth remain largely unknown, MoMaS allows to reproduce series of plausible growth trajectories that were previously unattainable. The framework facilitates the modeling of individual-level behaviors such as reluctance, neutrality, and loyalty, alongside aggregate-level dynamics like critical mass, bandwagon effects, and both positive and negative cross-side network effects.
We illustrate the capabilities of MoMaS through an extensive set of real-world experiments. Our results demonstrate that once the platform acquires critical mass, it triggers a significant positive cross-side network effect, accelerating growth. However, this can be reversed if a negative cross-side network effect is triggered, leading to the collapse of the platform. MoMaS is applicable for real-sized problems and available on public repository along with reproducible experiments.</p>

      <p>On-demand feeder bus services present an innovative solution to urban mobility challenges, yet their success depends on a thorough assessment and strategic planning. Despite their potential, a systematic methodology for selecting suitable service areas remains underdeveloped. Simulation Framework for Feeder Location Evaluation (SimFLEX) utilizes spatial, demographic, and transportation-specific characteristics to conduct simulations at a microscopic level and compute various key performance indicators (KPIs), including service attractiveness, waiting time reduction, and added value. To address the stochastic nature of demand and uncertainty embedded in mode choice, we leverage Monte Carlo analysis, capturing variability across simulated scenarios. Our framework integrates several methods for a complete assessment of feeder potential: microscopic demand generation, creation of shared rides, public transport modeling, and iterative traveler learning and stabilization approach. Once the system stabilizes, KPIs are computed for comparative and sensitivity analyzes. As a showcase for our method, we apply SimFLEX to compare two remote districts in Krakow, Poland – Bronowice and Skotniki – designated as candidates for service deployment. Despite similar urban characteristics, our analysis revealed notable differences in KPIs between the analyzed areas: Skotniki exhibited higher service attractiveness (around 30 %) and added value (up to 7 %), whereas Bronowice showed greater potential for reducing waiting times (around 77 %). To assess the robustness of SimFLEX outputs under uncertain behavioral assumptions, we conducted a sensitivity analysis across a range of alternative-specific constants. The results consistently confirmed Skotniki as the more suitable candidate for feeder service implementation, demonstrating that this conclusion holds despite variations in a key preference parameter. The SimFLEX framework can be instrumental for decision makers to estimate feeder potential for a designated area. The model’s flexibility and modular characteristics make it a versatile tool for policymakers and urban planners to enhance urban mobility.</p>

      <p>Before the pandemic, ride-pooling was a promising mode of urban mobility, marked by increasing service providers and increasing traveller adoption, critical to its efficiency and sustainability. However, the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruption, with services suspended, business models altered, and reduced traveller confidence. In the post-pandemic era, understanding the future of ride-pooling is crucial. This article reviews the market through literature, pooling availability, and traveller behaviour studies. We find that the core elements of the ride-pooling model remain intact, with potential to appeal to travellers, drivers, platforms, and policymakers. Changes in travel behaviour due to the pandemic appear temporary, with a high willingness to share rides and reduce costs. However, whether ride-pooling can regain its growth remains uncertain. Despite unprecedented start-up activity, the financial prospects are unclear, posing challenges to its resurgence as a sustainable mobility solution.</p>
