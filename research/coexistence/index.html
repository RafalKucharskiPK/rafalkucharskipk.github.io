<blockquote>
  <p>What will be the future of our cities with autonomous vehicles, using any kind of ML algorithms to make collective routing decisions? <strong>Let’s see what we know so far</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We pioneer the very specific problem that our cities may face in the future, when autonomous vehicles are efficiently navigating across our cities. 
They will, individually or collectively, make routing decisions. The same decisions that are now made daily by millions of human drivers worldwide, and resulting in traffic jams and complex congestion patterns, will be delegated to machines.
What will it change? <strong>Let’s see</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> <span style="color:red"> we do not address the autonomous driving itself and operations. We assume that AVs can navigate well in our cities, including starting, driving, cruising, detecting objects, stopping, obeying traffic rules, and parking. </span> Dozens of excellent research teams already contribute to this. We address the follow-up problem: <em>What happens when CAVs will start making their own decisions, specifically routing decisions</em>. We anegdotically compare it to the case of a toddler who learns how to walk, but the true problems come with teenagers who may start to decide (e.g., on the colour of hair, tattoos, career, etc). Notably, we assume that traffic flow operations of CAVs are indistinguishable from human driving (differences found here may amplify when we include CAV traffic flow advantages).</p>

  <p>We show that <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12862" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Equilibria in routing games with connected autonomous vehicles will not be strong, as exclusive clubs may form</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>CAVs will be able to break from the Nash equilibrium and form coalitions, collaborating to devise a joint routing pattern that allows them to arrive faster. However, with limited resources, i.e., the capacity in road networks, a
group arriving faster will gain at the expense of others arriving later. Also, not everyone can be invited to join the group as it remains efficient only until
some point. Thus, such groups will be exclusive, and, like other exclusive goods, they will be available to the masses and limited to upper classes only. Threatening the equity of using public space of our cities.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We demonstrate the fleet may intentionally bring chaos to our cities to maximise market share - <a href="arxiv">here</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is the optimal strategy to maximise market share and convince most drivers to join the CAV fleet? Surprisingly, <strong>bringing chaos</strong> may be quite effective. Controlled oscillations of traffic flows, predictable by fleet operators but surprising to humans, may be frustrating enough to convince others to abandon human driving and join a fleet. Individually tailored offers (just like Uber, Amazon, or Ryanair) leveraging on our behavioural traits may be exploitable as well, and our low expectations (due to low budget or high urgency) may enable network-wide strange assignment plans, ultimately leading to increasing market shares. Those are initial results from a monopoly, where a single operator competes with humans, which are likely to be even worse in the case when competing fleets launch aggressive campaigns deployed in our cities.</p>

  <p>New concept of Wardrop Cyclical Equilibrium is both optimal and fair for CAVs as we show <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19675" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) open the possibility for centralized routing with full compliance, making System-Optimal traffic assignment attainable. However, as System Optimum makes some drivers better off than others, voluntary acceptance seems dubious. To overcome this issue, we propose a new concept of <em>Wardropian cycles</em>, which, in contrast to previous utopian visions, ensures both fairness and optimality, thereby satisfying Wardrop’s principles. Such cycles, represented as sequences of permutations in the daily assignment matrices, always exist and equalize, after a limited number of days, the average travel times among travelers (similar to User Equilibrium), while preserving the everyday optimality of path flows (similar to System Optimum). In Barcelona, 670 vehicle-hours of Price-of-Anarchy are eliminated using cycles with a median length of 11 days.</p>

<p>RouteRL is a novel framework that integrates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with a microscopic traffic simulation to develop efficient collective route choice strategies for autonomous vehicles (AVs). The proposed framework models the daily urban route choices of driver agents of two types: human drivers, emulated using behavioral route choice models, and AVs, modeled as MARL agents optimizing their policies for a predefined objective. RouteRL aims to advance research in MARL, transport modeling, and human–AI interaction for transportation applications.</p>

  <p>Only a few of the SOTA Reinforcement Learning algorithms managed to find the optimal routing strategy in a trivial case with 10 AVs and two routes, as we report in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13188" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Autonomous vehicles (AVs), which may utilize Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for simultaneous route optimization, may destabilize traffic networks, potentially leading to longer travel times for human drivers. We study this interaction by simulating human drivers and AVs. Our experiments with standard MARL algorithms reveal that, both in simplified and complex networks, policies often fail to converge to an optimal solution or require long training periods. This problem is amplified by the fact that we cannot rely entirely on simulated training, as there are no accurate models of human routing behavior. At the same time, real-world training in cities risks destabilizing urban traffic systems, increasing externalities, such as CO2 emissions, and introducing non-stationarity as human drivers will adapt unpredictably to AV behaviors.</p>

<h4 id="it-is-better-to-be-a-good-socially-aware-cav-than-selfish">It is better to be a good socially aware CAV than selfish</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Autonomous vehicles need social awareness in their reward to find optima in multi-agent reinforcement learning routing games, as we show <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11410" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Previous work has shown that when multiple selfish Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are introduced to future cities and start learning optimal routing strategies using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), they may destabilize traffic systems, as they would require a significant amount of time to converge to the optimal solution, equivalent to years of real-world commuting.
We demonstrate that moving beyond the selfish component in the reward significantly relieves this issue. If each AV, apart from minimizing its own travel time, aims to reduce its impact on the system, this will be beneficial not only for the system-wide performance but also for each individual player in this routing game.
By introducing an intrinsic reward signal based on the marginal cost matrix, we significantly reduce training time and achieve convergence more reliably. 
Our results optimistically indicate that social awareness (i.e., including marginal costs in routing decisions) improves both the system-wide and individual performance of future urban systems with AVs.</p>

  <p>In this <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-90783-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a>, we show that the strategy CAVs are allowed to adopt may result in human drivers either benefiting or being systematically disadvantaged and urban networks becoming either more or less optimal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Studying the simplest of the two-route bottleneck macroscopic network, we discover that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The choices of CAVs that replace a given share of HDVs differ significantly from the choices of the remaining HDVs.</li>
  <li>In different scenarios the average travel time of both HDVs and CAVs may increase or decrease.</li>
  <li>If the fleet of CAVs applies the selfish strategy, it may improve its collective travel time at a cost to human drivers when the share of CAVs is small.</li>
  <li>For a large share of CAVs, the selfish or social strategies of CAVs may result in improvement of travel times for all the drivers. This, however, comes at a price of reduced equity.</li>
  <li>Human driver populations with low perception bias may be less prone to exploitation by intelligent fleets of CAVs than more diverse and less optimal populations.</li>
  <li>Heavily congested systems, where the choices of HDVs and CAVs tend to be similar, may be less susceptible to exploitation by CAVs. Conversely, uncongested networks could be easily exploited by machines.</li>

  <p>Antisocial individual vehicles of a coordinated fleet will be detectable, as we prove in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22966" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Detection of collectively routing fleets of vehicles in future urban systems may become important for the management of traffic, as such routing may destabilize urban networks, leading to deterioration of
driving conditions. To address this issue, we address two related problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is it possible to determine the flow of fleet vehicles on all routes given the fleet size and behaviour as well as the combined total flows?</li>
</ul>

<p>We prove that the answer is <strong>yes</strong> for myopic fleet strategies which are more <em>selfish</em> than <em>altruistic</em>, and
<strong>no</strong> otherwise.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is it possible to identify the individual vehicles of a coordinated fleet from daily route choice observations of individual vehicles?</li>
</ul>

<p>Our finginds indicate that the answer is likely to be <strong>yes</strong> for anisocial fleet objectives and <em>no</em> for pro-social fleet objectives.</p>

We want to understand the future of Urban Mobility and foresee what happens when our cities are shared with autonomous, intelligent robots - competing with us for limited resources. 
* We demonstrated the novel phenomena on simple topologies [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-90783-w)
* We created the dedicated MARL environment for our experiments [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20065) and repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/COeXISTENCE-PROJECT/RouteRL)
* We have some preliminary results from [EWRL](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=88zP8xh5D2)
* We identified issues with convergence and reported them [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13188)

. We create virtual environments where individual agents compete to arrive faster, more reliably and cheaper at their destinations.  Human agents are simulated with detailed behavioural models, estimated and calibrated on the field data to reproduce how we behave and adapt in the cities. In the same environment the deep learning agents try the same - they  use deep reinforcement learning to maximise their rewards. This creates a harsh competition in which machines have upper-hands strong enough to beat us. 



*COeXISTENCE* is a broad and deep experiment in virtual environment on future cities, aimed to discover the new phenomena and propose the new solutions. 
It spans between fields as diverse as:

* game theory;
* deep reinforcement learning;
* complex social systems;
* sustainability;
* urban mobility;
* agent based modelling;
* discrete choice theory.

      <p>Ride-sourcing platforms such as Uber and Lyft are prime examples of the gig economy, recruiting drivers as independent contractors, thereby avoiding legal and fiscal obligations. Although platforms offer flexibility in choosing work shifts and areas, many drivers experience low income and poor working conditions, leading to widespread strikes and protests. Minimum wage regulation is adopted to improve drivers welfare. However, the impacts of this regulation on drivers as well as on travelers and platforms, remain largely unknown. While ride-sourcing platforms do not disclose the relevant data, state-of-the-art models fail to explain the effects of minimum wage regulation on market dynamics. In this study, we assess the effectiveness and implications of minimum wage regulation in ride-sourcing markets while simulating the detailed dynamics of ride-sourcing markets under varying regulation intensities, both with and without the so-called platform lockout strategy. Our findings reveal that minimum wage regulation impacts substantially drivers income, and may lead to higher fares for travelers and threaten platforms survival. When platforms adopt a lockout strategy, their profitability significantly improves and drivers earn more, although many others lose their jobs, and service level for travelers consequently declines.</p>

      <p>Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) promise to reduce congestion in future urban networks, potentially by optimizing their routing decisions. Unlike for human drivers, these decisions can be made with collective, data-driven policies, developed by machine learning algorithms. Reinforcement learning (RL) can facilitate the development of such collective routing strategies, yet standardized and realistic benchmarks are missing. To that end, we present \our: Urban Routing Benchmark for RL-equipped Connected Autonomous Vehicles. \our is a comprehensive benchmarking environment that unifies evaluation across 29 real-world traffic networks paired with realistic demand patterns. \our comes with a catalog of predefined tasks, four state-of-the-art multi-agent RL (MARL) algorithm implementations, three baseline methods, domain-specific performance metrics, and a modular configuration scheme. Our results suggest that, despite the lengthy and costly training, state-of-the-art MARL algorithms rarely outperformed humans. Experimental results reported in this paper initiate the first leaderboard for MARL in large-scale urban routing optimization and reveal that current approaches struggle to scale, emphasizing the urgent need for advancements in this domain.</p>

      <p>RouteRL is a novel framework that integrates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with a microscopic traffic simulation for the development of efficient collective route choice strategies for autonomous vehicles (AVs). The proposed framework models the daily urban route choices of driver agents of two types: human drivers, emulated using behavioral route choice models, and AVs, modeled as MARL agents optimizing their policies for a predefined objective. RouteRL aims to advance research in MARL, transport modeling, and human–AI interaction for transportation applications. This study presents a technical report on RouteRL, outlines its potential research contributions, and showcases its impact via illustrative examples. Initial findings show that human travel times could increase following the introduction of AVs in urban environments, highlighting the importance of future studies to support efficient urban mobility.</p>

      <p>Suppose in a stable urban traffic system populated only by human driven vehicles (HDVs), a given proportion (e.g. 10 %) is replaced by a fleet of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), which share information and pursue a collective goal. Suppose these vehicles are centrally coordinated and differ from HDVs only by their collective capacities allowing them to make more efficient routing decisions before the travel on a given day begins. Suppose there is a choice between two routes and every day each driver makes a decision which route to take. Human drivers maximize their utility. CAVs might optimize different goals, such as the total travel time of the fleet. We show that in this plausible futuristic setting, the strategy CAVs are allowed to adopt may result in human drivers either benefitting or being systematically disadvantaged and urban networks becoming more or less optimal. Consequently, some regulatory measures might become indispensable.</p>

      <p>This study examines the potential impact of reinforcement learning (RL)-enabled autonomous vehicles (AV) on urban traffic flow in a mixed traffic environment. We focus on a simplified day-to-day route choice problem in a multi-agent setting. We consider a city network where human drivers travel through their chosen routes to reach their destinations in minimum travel time. Then, we convert one-third of the population into AVs, which are RL agents employing Deep Q-learning algorithm. We define a set of optimization targets, or as we call them behaviors, namely selfish, collaborative, competitive, social, altruistic, and malicious. We impose a selected behavior on AVs through their rewards. We run our simulations using our in-house developed RL framework PARCOUR. Our simulations reveal that AVs optimize their travel times by up to 5%, with varying impacts on human drivers’ travel times depending on the AV behavior. In all cases where AVs adopt a self-serving behavior, they achieve shorter travel times than human drivers. Our findings highlight the complexity differences in learning tasks of each target behavior. We demonstrate that the multi-agent RL setting is applicable for collective routing on traffic networks, though their impact on coexisting parties greatly varies with the behaviors adopted.</p>

      <p>Previous work has shown that when multiple selfish Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are introduced to future cities and start learning optimal routing strategies using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), they may destabilize traffic systems, as they would require a significant amount of time to converge to the optimal solution, equivalent to years of real-world commuting. We demonstrate that moving beyond the selfish component in the reward significantly relieves this issue. If each AV, apart from minimizing its own travel time, aims to reduce its impact on the system, this will be beneficial not only for the system-wide performance but also for each individual player in this routing game. By introducing an intrinsic reward signal based on the marginal cost matrix, we significantly reduce training time and achieve convergence more reliably. Marginal cost quantifies the impact of each individual action (route-choice) on the system (total travel time). Including it as one of the components of the reward can reduce the degree of non-stationarity by aligning agents’ objectives. Notably, the proposed counterfactual formulation preserves the system’s equilibria and avoids oscillations. Our experiments show that training MARL algorithms with our novel reward formulation enables the agents to converge to the optimal solution, whereas the baseline algorithms fail to do so. We show these effects in both a toy network and the real-world network of Saint-Arnoult. Our results optimistically indicate that social awareness (i.e., including marginal costs in routing decisions) improves both the system-wide and individual performance of future urban systems with AVs.</p>

      <p>User Equilibrium is the standard representation of the so-called routing game in which drivers adjust their route choices to arrive at their destinations as fast as possible. Asking whether this Equilibrium is strong or not was meaningless for human drivers who did not form coalitions due to technical and behavioral constraints. This is no longer the case for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), which will be able to communicate and collaborate to jointly form routing coalitions. We demonstrate this for the first time on a carefully designed toy-network example, where a ‘club‘ of three autonomous vehicles jointly decides to deviate from the user equilibrium and benefit (arrive faster). The formation of such a club has negative consequences for other users, who are not invited to join it and now travel longer, and for the system, making it suboptimal and disequilibrated, which triggers adaptation dynamics. This discovery has profound implications for the future of our cities. We demonstrate that, if not prevented, CAV operators may intentionally disequilibrate traffic systems from their classic Nash equilibria, benefiting their own users and imposing costs on others. These findings suggest the possible emergence of an exclusive CAV elite, from which human-driven vehicles and non-coalition members may be excluded, potentially leading to systematically longer travel times for those outside the coalition, which would be harmful for the equity of public road networks.</p>

      <p>Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) open the possibility for centralised routing with full compliance, making System Optimal traffic assignment attainable. However, as System Optimum makes some drivers better off than others, voluntary acceptance seems dubious. To overcome this issue, we propose a new concept of Wardropian cycles, which, in contrast to previous utopian visions, makes the assignment fair on top of being optimal, which amounts to satisfaction of both Wardrop’s principles. Such cycles, represented as sequences of permutations to the daily assignment matrices, always exist and equalise, after a limited number of days, average travel times among travellers (like in User Equilibrium) while preserving everyday optimality of path flows (like in System Optimum). We propose exact methods to compute such cycles and reduce their length and within-cycle inconvenience to the users. As identification of optimal cycles turns out to be NP-hard in many aspects, we introduce a greedy heuristic efficiently approximating the optimal solution. Finally, we introduce and discuss a new paradigm of Cyclical User Equilibrium, which ensures stability of optimal Wardropian Cycles under unilateral deviations. We complement our theoretical study with large-scale simulations. In Barcelona, 670 vehicle-hours of Price-of-Anarchy are eliminated using cycles with a median length of 11 days-though 5% of cycles exceed 90 days. However, in Berlin, just five days of applying the greedy assignment rule significantly reduces initial inequity. In Barcelona, Anaheim, and Sioux Falls, less than 7% of the initial inequity remains after 10 days, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in improving traffic performance with more ubiquitous social acceptability.</p>

      <p>Autonomous vehicles (AVs) using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for simultaneous route optimization may destabilize traffic environments, with human drivers possibly experiencing longer travel times. We study this interaction by simulating human drivers and AVs. Our experiments with standard MARL algorithms reveal that, even in trivial cases, policies often fail to converge to an optimal solution or require long training periods. The problem is amplified by the fact that we cannot rely entirely on simulated training, as there are no accurate models of human routing behavior. At the same time, real-world training in cities risks destabilizing urban traffic systems, increasing externalities, such as CO2 emissions, and introducing non-stationarity as human drivers adapt unpredictably to AV behaviors. Centralization can improve convergence in some cases, however, it raises privacy concerns for the travelers’ destination data. In this position paper, we argue that future research must prioritize realistic benchmarks, cautious deployment strategies, and tools for monitoring and regulating AV routing behaviors to ensure sustainable and equitable urban mobility systems.</p>
